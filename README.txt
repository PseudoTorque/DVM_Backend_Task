I have tested all the normal use cases as well as the edge cases. Data is stored in the data.json file and is loaded and saved via a mock server (Server.py). The physical ATM 
is represented in the ATM file (ATM.py). All the object classes (Account, Card and User) are stored in their respective files and imported into the others when needed. Bonus 
functionality of having a three strike block on the card has been added. Text has been formatted for flavour. For those using the program, start main.py and navigate using on-screen
instructions. There are checks on everything to ensure no redundancy and proper consistency. Data is saved after every transaction so program interruption won't affect important 
data points. I was shifted to backend on the 5th and have submitted it in 2 days time.
